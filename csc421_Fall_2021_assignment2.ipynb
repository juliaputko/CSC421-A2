Using selenium Python bindings https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/ access the webpage and scrape at least three categories. Your code should scrape the information from the pages and convert it into relationships and facts in first-order logic using the syntax of expressions in logic.ipynb. Once you build your knowledge-base then write 4 non-trivial queries that show-case the expressiveness of FOL. These queries should not be possible to be answered easily using the web interface i.e they should have some logical connectives, more than one possible answer etc. The translation of the song facts from the web page to FOL should NOT be done by hand but using the web scraping tool you develop. You can use multiple cells in your answer."
